        <h4 class="heading-style">My Hobbies</h4>
       
        <p class=".paragraph-style">Some of my hobbies include volleyball, watersports, and helping the environment. I'm currently a volleyball player at BYU. I grew up in Hawaii. Being around the ocean surfing with my family is one of my favorite pastime activities. When I'm not on the court or catching waves, I spend my free time removing invasive plants to help the natural environment.
            <br> <br>In addition to my passion for volleyball, watersports, and environmental conservation, I find immense joy in connecting with nature through hiking and exploring the diverse landscapes of Hawaii. The lush greenery and breathtaking scenery have inspired me to become actively involved in conservation efforts beyond removing invasive plants. I've participated in local beach cleanups and collaborated with community organizations to raise awareness about the importance of preserving our natural resources.
            <br> <br>
            Growing up in Hawaii has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the cultural richness of the islands. I often engage in traditional Hawaiian practices, such as hula dancing and learning about the historical significance of various landmarks. These experiences have not only shaped my worldview but have also fueled my commitment to sustainable living.
            <br> <br>
            As a student-athlete at BYU, I've had the opportunity to balance my academic pursuits with my athletic endeavors. Pursuing a degree in environmental science, I aspire to combine my love for the environment with my academic knowledge to contribute meaningfully to ecological preservation. Through my journey at BYU, I hope to inspire others to appreciate the beauty of our planet and take active steps towards its conservation.
